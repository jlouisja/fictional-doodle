        <p>I'm not sure what you reading this or I writing this will acheive, but I hope it is something.</p>
        <p>It may be this bulletproof coffee, but I feel amazing this morning. It's the last day of the calendar year and I feel ambitious, anxious, nervous, excited, and hopeful for the new year.</p>
        <p>2019. One more year until the roaring 20's.. That's insane. I remember thinking about being in the year 2020 while reading The Great Gatsby in high school. I specifically remember dreading how old I would be at that point in time. I remember thinking, "Hmm.. I'll be 25, I'll have my bachelor's degree in criminal justice (lol), I'll be married, have at least one child and possibly one on the way, I'd live in a big house with my wonderful husband who I had married 3 years prior, and I would be soo happy... Lol sike!! In all honesty, a large part of this fantasy could still come true.</p>
        <p>Being that this blog is one of my major long term goals for this new year, I want to begin by listing some of my other goals for this. I'm hoping that those of you reading this, if any, will help me hold myself accountable for some of these. </p>
