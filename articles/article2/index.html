        <h2>I didn't want to do the WOD yesterday because we had to run..</h2>
        <p>.. so I did the WOD yesterday.</p>
        <p>Yesterday I really got to measure my growth as an athlete. It might sound like a small feat, but I went to class yesterday knowing we would be doing a workout that I hate. </p>

        <p>Here's a look at the workout</p>
        <h3>WOD<br>
            4 Rounds - E4mom<br>
            400 m Run<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; Rx2: 200 m Run<br>
            12 Cleans 155/105<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; Rx2: 115/75<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; Rx3: 75/55<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; Rx(+): 185/115<br>
            
            *Score = Cleans. 48 total Cleans</h3>
        <p>I've been playing sports since I was 7 years old. Just recently I stopped calling myself an athlete though. Why? My mile time is 10 min+ and for some reason I cannot believe that any athlete of the sports that I play should have that time.</p>
        <p>To be totally transparent, I was 100% the type of student the be coincidently "sick" on mile day in PE. </p>
